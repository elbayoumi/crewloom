# Repository architecture

[Public architecture](../documentation/ARCHITECTURE.md) describes the toolkit boundaries. [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) is the single authority for agent behavior. Public role procedures and core tools improve in their existing paths; do not maintain duplicate versioned implementations.

Model generation passes explicit project text to a trusted CLI in a temporary directory; the artifact layer validates writes and the Docker executor verifies code. Host CLI flags are not an OS sandbox. Trial treatment labels remain outside the deterministic scorer.
